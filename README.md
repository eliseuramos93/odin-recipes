# Recipes Website

## About this repo

A brazilian recipes webpage build as a part of the Foundations course @ The Odin Project. 

The first iteration of the project focus on the HTML aspect of an webpage, using tags such as headings, paragraphs, anchors, images, unordered and ordered lists, and basic HTML document structure (boilerplate).

## Assignment

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure
1. Create an `index.html` file
2. Fill it out with the usual boiler plate and add an `h1` heading "Odin Recipes" to the body

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
1. Create a new directory within the `odin-recipes` directory and name it `recipes`
2. Create a new HTML file within the `recipes` directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. (EX: `lasagna.html`)
3. Add a link to the recipe page recently created.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
Include the following content in the recipe page:
1. An image of the finished dish under a `h1` heading;
2. An appropriately sized "Description" heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe;
3. An "ingredients` heading followed by an **unordered list** of the ingredients needed for the recipe;
4. A "steps" heading followed by an **ordered list** of the steps needed for making the dish.

### Iteration 4: Add more recipes
1. Add two more recipes with identical page structures
2. Link the new recipes on the index page.
