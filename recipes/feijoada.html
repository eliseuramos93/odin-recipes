    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Feijoada is a stew of beans with beef and pork. The name is derived from the word <em>feijão</em> (bean, in portuguese). 
    The stew is best prepared over low heat in a thick clay pot, which provides a slow cooking process which brings out the most of this dish. 
    It's usually served with white rice, farinha and steamed kale, but there are regional variants of the side dishes throughout all of Brazil's regions.</p>

    <p>Feijoada is widely considered throughout Brazil its national dish, and usually served on specific days accordingly to the location. For example, it is
      served on fridays in Rio de Janeiro, while it is common to find feijoadas being served on wedsnedays and saturdays in São Paulo. This is a dish meant to be
    enjoyed throughout the day and not eaten under rushed circumstances - it's almost offensive to rush a brazilian while they are eating their soul food.</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients - Main Stew</h2>
    <p><em>20 portions - We like to eat. A lot.</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1kg dry black beans</li>
      <li>70g pork ears</li>
      <li>70g pork feet</li>
      <li>50g pork loin</li>
      <li>150g portuguese sausage (as a brazilian, I <strong>strongly</strong> advice against trying 
        to use pepperoni as a substitute - <strong><em>this is a stew, not a pizza</em></strong>)</li>
      <li>100g <em>carne seca</em> (again, friendly brazilian tip: translator says it's the same as jerked beef, but I guarantee you it ain't the same
        and your taste buds will <strong>show you no mercy</strong> if you choose to ignore this tip)</li>
      <li>70g pork tail</li>
      <li>100g pork ribs</li>
      <li>100g paio sausage</li>
      <li>2 big regular onions, chopped</li>
      <li>3 bay leaves</li>
      <li>chopped green onion</li>
      <li>40ml brazilian cachaça</li>
      <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>1 or 2 oranges</li>
      <li>black pepper</li>
      <li>salt </li>
      <br>
      <em>If you feel like it, you can also add bacon cubes in the stew. But I don't recomend it as a replacement, only as a additive.</em>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The day before <em>(yep, you've read it right)</em>, soak the beans and salted meat separately, changing the water in the meat a few times;</li>
      <li>On the day which you'll eat the feijoada, cook the black beans in three liters of water;</li>
      <li>Wash one more time the pork parts, and cook them in a separate pot;</li>
      <li>When the beans are almost done, add all of the pork parts and sausages;</li>
      <li>Leave the stew for a while (10-20 minutes), and remove the fat excess from it;</li>
      <li>If necessary, add more water;</li>
      <li><em>Sauté</em> the onion and the garlic, then add it to the stew pot;</li>
      <li>Give it a good mix, and leave it cooking for 20-40 minutes, depending on the water quantity.</li>
    </ol>
