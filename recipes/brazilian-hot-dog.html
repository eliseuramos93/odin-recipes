    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Brazil, we like to improve on other countries' traditional dishes. And by that, I mean to put a 
      <br>lot more stuff on it, and make it better. If you guys think we're insane by doing this to hot dogs,
      <br> you really should look into what we've done with pizza (and may I say it, we perfected it in São Paulo.)
      <br>As for hot dogs, in Osasco (city in the São Paulo's metropolitan area) is where we've perfected it. It's 
      <br>considered as the world capital of hot dog (and if you're offended by it, it displays you've yet to learn
      <br> the full potential of a hot dog.) 
    </p>

    <p>Think of it as something close to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSFgDZJVYbo">Joey's food combination logic</a>: 
    <em>If two things taste good separately, 
    <br>it will taste even better together</em>. Normally, we won't break any good-sense boundaries (like putting 
    <br>candies on it), but never doubt our creative capability to make something look weird and taste good. So 
    <br>odds are you'll find somewhere in the country (Brazil is big, after all) people making hot dogs that 
    <br>sounds almost blasphemous, but probably taste wonderful.</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomato-based sauce (not ketchup, yet)</li>
      <li>Hot dogs (2 per portion, minimum)</li>
      <li>Mashed potatoes (the perfect bonding agent)</li>
      <li>Minced fried bacon (you really though we would leave bacon out of it?)</li>
      <li>Brazilian shoestring potato sticks (we call it <em>batata-palha</em> around here)</li>
      <li>Ketchup (there you go)</li>
      <li>Mustard</li>
      <li>Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>Melted cheddar cheese (just like McDonald's Cheddar McMelt... yeah baby)</li>
      <li>Hot dog breads, big ones (we're filling this bad boy up!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients I've seen in brazilian hot dogs, but aren't my recomendations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tomato vinagrete</li>
      <li>Corn</li>
      <li>Lettuce</li>
      <li>Olives</li>
      <li>Pimenta malagueta</li>
      <li>Quail eggs (This is some Rio de Janeiro stuff. They're like our version of Florida)</li>
      <li>Beanless chilli (basically, minced meat cooked in tomato sauce)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook your hot dogs in the tomato sauce, so it gets some extra flavor;</li>
      <li>Open your bread up, but don't go through it - you need it to hold our pile of food</li>
      <li>Start with the mayonnaise inside the bread</li>
      <li>Time a thin layer of ketchup and mustard (you can put more on top after too, we also do it)</li>
      <li>Enter the hot dogs. One is being cheap, we usually put two, three is overkill unless your bread is REALLY big</li>
      <li>Throw some bacon on it</li>
      <li>Give it a nice cover with melted cheddar</li>
      <li>Now it's time to put the responsible for holding it all together: mashed potatoes.</li>
      <li>Throw some <em>batata-palha</em> on top of the mashed potatoes, to bring a nice texture to it</li>
      <li>Add ketchup, mustard or any sauce of your preference on top of it</li>
    </ol>
