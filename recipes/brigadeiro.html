    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you have never eaten brigadeiros before, you're in Bruno Mars' shoes: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-fA-gBCkj0">locked out of heaven</a>. This brazilian classic 
    <br> dessert is a mandatory presence in every birthday party in Brazil (I am not exagerating here), specially the ones made 
    <br>for children. If you don't want to see children crying (or maybe killing people before becoming of age), better have 
    <br>(a lot of) brigadeiros in their birthday parties.</p>  
    
    <p>If you aren't a big fan of sweets, like me, you'll still love it. But, if you're a chocolate lover... Get ready for the 
    <br>best experience of your life (again, not exagerating).</p>

    <p>But the true beauty of it lies in the simplicity: most of our awesome recipes need an ingredient characteristic of Brazil 
      <br>(like tapioca flour), or something which probably was brought here from the portuguese or african people way back then. 
      <br>But brigadeiro is different: it only needs four Ingredients for the traditional shape (little heaven spheres covered in 
      <br>chocolate sprinkles), or three if you just want the version to be eaten with spoons. </p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Condensed milk</li>
      <li>Non-salted butter (insert Julia Childs meme here)</li>
      <li>Chocolate powder (if you put it in your milk to give it a chocolate flavor, works here)</li>
      <li>Chocolate sprinkles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Put the condensed milk, butter and chocolate powder in a pan</li>
      <li>Bring it to medium heat, stiring it</li>
      <li>Don't stop stiring until the mix texture starts to change</li>
      <li>When the texture has changed, pour it into a bowl or a plate and let it cool down</li>
      
      <h4>After cooling down, you have what we call as a "spoon brigadeiro", because in this state we eat it with a spoon. 
        <br>If you want the party version which looks like a truffle (see image on top of page), follow these steps:
      </h4>
      <li>Grease your hands in butter</li>
      <li>Take a portion of brigadeiro (1 spoon scoop) and put in your hand</li>
      <li>Shape it with your hands to make a sphere</li>
      <li>Cover its entire surface with chocolate sprinkles</li>
      <li>Wash your hands, eat it and discover what heaven tastes like</li>
    </ol>
